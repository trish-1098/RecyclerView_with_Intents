# RecyclerView_with_Intents
In this project I have demonstrated the use of RecyclerView with The Adapter class also implemented.
How to handle the onClick Events on various child views of a single list item in the RecyclerView ? 
The above question is also answered.
The use of Intents is also demonstrated.
The whole description of what is happening is also there in the comments and it is written in the simplest language possible.
Still if anyone finds anything wrong,feel free to comment the problem?
Thanks.
